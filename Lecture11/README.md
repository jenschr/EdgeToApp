# Lecture 11
This repository contains source code from the eleventh EdgeToApp lecture

To have a fully working backend for the App, [clone this repository](https://github.com/jenschr/product_api), install dependencies and start it. This wil setup the required database and insert sample data to work with. Requires a fully working Mongoose setup on your local machine.

These folders hold the progress from a React App to a React Native App. 

- **shopping-list-appstarter** The React app when we start the lecture

- **shopping-list-app-finished** The app with the added "bonus" feature

- **ShoppingApp-before-skinning** The app after converting it the React Native, but before we add the styling

- **ShoppingApp-after-skinning** The React Native app when it's finished skinning

- **MobileShopping** the first version I did of the React Native conversion that has alternate approaches to some things.
