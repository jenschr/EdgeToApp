# TestMqtt
Very basic and simple Platformio project for getting started with MQTT on ESP32 S3. Made for my students [@kristiania](https://github.com/kristiania), the example does not contain "everything" like all other "basic" examples do. It just contains what is needed to understand Publish & Subscribe. 
The Mqtt library used is the ["arduino-mqtt"](https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt) wrapper for [lwmqtt](https://github.com/256dpi/lwmqtt) by the same author.
